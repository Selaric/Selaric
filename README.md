# 👋 About Me

AI Engineer focused on building and deploying intelligent systems across large language models, probabilistic reasoning, robotics, and applied machine learning.

I  like to design alignment-aware LLM pipelines, robust retrieval systems, multimodal models, and cloud-deployed AI infrastructure. My work centers on evaluation, uncertainty, automation, and creating measurable value through scalable AI systems.
